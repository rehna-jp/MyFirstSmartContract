# MyFirstSmartContract
Has been a bit difficult with catching up with the course and assignment deadline for the past three weeks.
This was due to problems with my laptop buh its all good now . Then another challenge i faced till now is linking my github repo to the remix IDE.
How i solved this was to practice and run my codes on remix to ensure it works and then  i copied the codes to a textfile i created and then pushed the textfile to my github 
repository.
